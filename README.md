# react-boilerplate

A very simple React boilerplate to get you started with React as soon as possible. Uses the Webpack development server
which will automatically build your bundle, serve assets, and refresh your page as soon as it detects a change.

## Includes

* Webpack + Webpack dev server.
* ES6 support via Babel
* CSS support
* SASS support
* Resolving for modules under `src` and `node_modules`

## Getting started

From the root directory:

* `npm install`
* `npm run`
* go to `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser

If you want to use other assets such as images, BMP files or WAV files you have to place them in your `build`
directory.
